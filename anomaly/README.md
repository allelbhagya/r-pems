1. **Unsupervised Learning Techniques**:

   - **Isolation Forest**: This technique works by isolating anomalies in a dataset using binary splitting. It's efficient for high-dimensional data and can handle large datasets.
   - **One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: It's used for novelty detection, where the model learns the characteristics of normal instances and flags anything deviating significantly as an anomaly.
   - **Density-Based Clustering Algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN)**: These algorithms identify clusters of normal data points and flag outliers as anomalies.

2. **Semi-Supervised Learning Techniques**:

   - **Autoencoders**: A type of neural network that learns to reconstruct input data. Anomalies lead to higher reconstruction errors, making them detectable.
   - **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)**: These are neural networks used for clustering. Anomalies are identified as data points that don't belong to any cluster.

3. **Supervised Learning Techniques**:
   - **Classification Algorithms**: Train a model using labeled data where anomalies are labeled, then use it to predict anomalies in new data. Algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Neural Networks can be effective.
   - **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models (e.g., Isolation Forest, SVM, Decision Trees) to improve overall anomaly detection performance.
